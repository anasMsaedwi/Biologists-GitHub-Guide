## Introduction

GitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaboration, widely used by developers but underutilized by biologists. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a guide specifically tailored for life scientists. It covers the basics of GitHub and walks you through its practical applications in bioinformatics, such as tracking changes to code, managing data sets, and collaborating on research projects.

## GitHub Fundamentals for Biologists

Welcome to the world of GitHub! This guide is designed to help biologists (and other life scientists) get started with GitHub, a powerful platform for version control and collaboration. Whether you're managing code, data, or documentation, GitHub can help you keep track of changes, collaborate with others, and share your work with the world.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses **Git**, a distributed version control system, to help developers (and scientists!) manage and track changes to their projects. GitHub provides a user-friendly interface for Git, making it easier to collaborate on code, data, and documentation.

Key features of GitHub include:
- **Version control**: Track changes to your files over time.
- **Collaboration**: Work with others on the same project.
- **Open science**: Share your work publicly or privately.
- **Issue tracking**: Manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
- **Documentation**: Host and share project documentation.

### Why Should Biologists Use GitHub?

As a biologist, you might wonder why GitHub is relevant to your work. Here are some reasons:

1. **Reproducibility**: GitHub helps you keep track of changes to your code, data, and analyses, making your research more reproducible.
2. **Collaboration**: Easily collaborate with colleagues on scripts, pipelines, and data analysis.
3. **Open Science**: Share your code, data, and workflows with the scientific community.
4. **Project Management**: Use GitHub Issues and Projects to manage tasks and track progress.
5. **Learning Resources**: Access and contribute to open-source bioinformatics tools and resources.

### Getting Started with GitHub

1. **Create a GitHub Account**: Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account.
2. **Install Git**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3. **Set Up Git**: Configure Git with your name and email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
